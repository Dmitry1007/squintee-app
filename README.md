## Squintee

I find squinting to be some type of epidemic, especially with people who work in front of a computer all day. Prolonged stress in the muscles around our eyes just canâ€™t be good for us. Squintee is a cross platform desktop application that uses a facial recognition API to detect squinting. Any user that has a webcam on her computer may open Squintee and leave it running in the background. Squintee fires off a notification every time a user squints, essentially re-training the user to stop this pesky habit. Users can set how sensitive they would like Squintee to be by using a horizontal scroller. Scroll all the way to the right and Squintee becomes more sensitive and fires off notifications at the slightest sign of Squinting.
